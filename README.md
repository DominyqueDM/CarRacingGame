# CarRacingGame
Another side gaming project of mine. Done using Visual Studio, .NET and Windows Forms.
the user uses the left and right keys to navigate the car. The user is required to avoid the other cars. As the game goes on, the speed is accelerated making the game more difficult. When the user eventually crashes, an explosion is shown along with a sound of a crash is played.

Attached is a preview of what the game looks like.
